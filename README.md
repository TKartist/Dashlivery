## GOAL:
- Data transformation to clean and organize data for the dashboard
- CCA (Crisis Categorization Analysis)

 
 ## TODO:
 - Data transformation for scatter (distribution) graph
 - Optimize the code for easier maintenance in the future
 - Data Completeness (as long as it is achieved; and the deadline hasn't passed)
 - General Performance (0 for Not achieved, 1 for achieved late, 2 for achieved early, if it is doesn't  then it is 2)
